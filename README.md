# The-Last-Stand

This is a text-based RPG that has been
designed to stimulate the brain. 

The player starts off as a traveller on a deserted island. He will be made
to navigate a map, go through the story, and solve fun puzzles along the
way. The game ends with a challenging boss fight. It is a short and
enjoyable experience.

This was made for the "Function Overload" competition at The Sanskriti School, for which a text based role player game had to be created in under 24 hours. This program was placed first in the tournament
